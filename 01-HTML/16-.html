        <p>
          The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only 
          domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat 
          or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept 
          as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids
          human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill 
          vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Evolution">Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 
          million years ago. The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.
           Results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through 
          sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial 
          selection.The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 
          38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes. The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was 
          tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no 
          trace in the domestic cat populations of today.

        <h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>
          The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat. It 
          averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with 
          about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically
           weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).
        </p>
        <h3>Skeleton</h3>
        <p>
          Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12);
           seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but 
           humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only 
           three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra 
           lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached 
           to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.: Unlike human arms, cat 
           forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to 
           pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.
        </p>
        <h3>Ambulation</h3>
        <p>
          The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower
          part of the visible leg. Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs 
          on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing 
          each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible 
          tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it 
          speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally 
          opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Behavior">Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at 
          night. Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but 
          can range many hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary 
          considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres). The timing 
          of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally 
          crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active in the morning and evening. However, house cats' 
          behavior is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns 
          to some extent.
          <br>Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily 
          duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats
           can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to 
           fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye 
           movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.

        <h2 id="Disease">Disease</h2>
        <p>
          About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human 
          inborn errors of metabolism. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals
           allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally
            developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the 
            human diseases. Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic
             infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and 
             arthritis. Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to 
             eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas.

        <h2 id="Mythology">History and mythology</h2>
        <p>
          In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, 
          sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian Herodotus reported 
          that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and 
          shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they 
          were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus expressed astonishment at the 
          domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.
