      <h2>What is?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> (WoW) is a <abbr title="Massively Multiplayer online Role-Playing 
        Game"><em>MMORPG</em></abbr> released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, <strong>World of Warcraft
        </strong> takes place within the world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft 
        III: The Frozen Throne. The game was announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise on November 
        23, 2004. Since launch, <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> has had nine major expansion packs: <em>The Burning Crusade </em> (2007), <em> 
          Wrath of the Lich King </em> (2008), <em> Cataclysm </em>(2010), <em> Mists of Pandaria </em> (2012), <em> Warlords of Draenor </em>
          (2014), <em>Legion </em> (2016), <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> (2018), <em>Shadowlands</em> (2020), and <em>Dragonflight </em>(2022).

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        As with other <abbr title="Massively Multiplayer online Role-Playing Game"><em>MMORPG</em></abbr>s, players control a character avatar 
        within a game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting 
        with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. Also similar to other <abbr title="Massively Multiplayer online Role-Playing Game"><em>
        MMORPG</em></abbr>s, <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> requires the player to pay for a subscription by using a credit or debit card, using 
        prepaid Blizzard game cards or using a WoW Token purchased in-game. Players without a subscription may use a trial account that lets the player 
        character reach up to level 20 but has many features locked.

      <h2>Reception</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> received very positive reviews upon release, following a period of high anticipation before launch. Although 
        the game follows a similar model to—and was noted for using many familiar concepts from—the role-playing genre, the new approaches to reducing 
        pauses between game encounters were well liked. A common example was the approach to character death. In some previous <abbr title="Massively 
        Multiplayer online Role-Playing Game"><em>MMORPG</em></abbr>s, a player would suffer a high penalty for character death; in <strong>World 
        of Warcraft</strong>, a player is able to recover and start playing quickly. Combat was another area where "downtime", or pauses between play, 
        was reduced. By allowing all character types to recover from damage taken, players can return to combat quickly. Reviewers felt that these 
        changes in pacing would make the genre more accessible to casual players—those who play for short periods of time— while still having "deep" 
        gameplay that would attract players of all levels of interest. The concept of a "rested bonus", or increasing the rate at which a player's 
        character gains experience, was also welcomed as a way for players to quickly catch up with their friends in progression.
