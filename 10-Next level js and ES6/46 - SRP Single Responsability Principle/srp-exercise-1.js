/* 
- This code does not resinate with the Single Responsibility Principle.
- The Person Class includes:
 * Person details, which it uses in the "greet()" method
 * AND validates the email ðŸ¤”
- Refactor the code to follow the Single Responsibility Principle. Something in this Person class seems too tightly coupled to it.
- A user should be able to:
* create a new instance of Person with a name and email
* validate the email and assign it to the Person instance if valid.
